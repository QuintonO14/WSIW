<h1 align="center">What Should I Watch? (WSIW)</h1>

Welcome to WSIW, an angular based web application that gets movie and television show recommendations for a user based off their given selections. WSIW utilizes **themoviedb.org api** to fetch appropriate titles for the user. With WSIW, a user can select up to five different genres and up to fifty different titles to generate their recommendations list. All recommendations come with a provided summary, premiere date, and a user consensus rating to give you the best insight into what you should be watching next! WSIW comes available as a PWA.
